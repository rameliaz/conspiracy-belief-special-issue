# The Enemy of the 'Ummah: Belief in Jewish conspiracy theories indirectly affecting vaccination decision

In this research, we aim to investigate the root of Jewish conspiracy belief and the impact of such conspiratorial thinking to vaccination decision, especially in Indonesian Muslims. To do so, we conducted two cross-sectional survey and one between-subject experimental study to test several hypotheses:
1. We suspect that individuals who perceive Jews as a symbolic threat would find Jewish conspiracy theories more convincing and such relationship would be partly explained (mediated) with religious zeal and collective narcissism.
2. Parents who believe in Jewish conspiracy theory would be more likely to delay vaccination for their children, and this relationship would be mediated by vaccine conspiracy belief. Parents who believe in Jewish conspiracy belief and think that religion is central to their life, would show a stronger approval to vaccine conspiracy theories.
3. Individuals whose moral identity as a Muslim is under attack, and exposed with vaccine disputations from religious authorities', would be more likely to endorse conspiracy theories regarding vaccination.
4. Those who blame on outgroups (Jews, Indonesian Chinese, and Chinese Nationals) for the coronavirus pandemic, would be more likely to refuse vaccination, while those who blame ingroups would less likely to do so.
